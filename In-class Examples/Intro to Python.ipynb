    "## Intro to Python and Jupter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook lets you write and execute Python code in your web browser. Jupyter notebooks make it very easy to tinker with code and execute it in bits and pieces; for this reason Jupyter notebooks are widely used in scientific computing. A Jupyter notebook is made up of a number of cells. Each cell can contain Python code or text. Every time a new cell is created, it's classified as a code cell. If you want it to be a text cell, choose `Markdown` instead of `Code` in the toolbar. You can execute any cell by clicking on it and pressing `Shift-Enter`, or clicking the `Run` button in the toolbar. When you do so, the code in the cell will run, and the output of the cell will be displayed beneath the cell. For example:"

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. Itâ€™s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments.
